By inspecting the "Differentiated Services Field" of the IP header, we can see several hex values (this field was added as a column to make it easier to visualize the hex values).

![DSF](DSF.png)

Converting those values to ASCII yields the string we were looking for.

```python
>>> chr(0x31)
'1'
>>> chr(0x78)
'x'
>>> chr(0x73)
's'
>>> chr(0x7a)
'z'
>>> chr(0x78)
'x'
>>> chr(0x78)
'x'
>>> chr(0x73)
's'
```

To extract only the relevant packets in Wireshark, this filter has been applied `(ip.src == 10.10.10.1) && (tcp.seq == 0)` and then used "Extract Packet Dissections" to extract it as a CSV.

After running `main.py` we find that the full string is `1xszxxssx*vx*pr|}!(/.p(,%|||'x|v'-()sr}.t}*r|x)q{."(wr*{z'zx4`.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("packetz.csv")

text = ""
for i in range(len(df["Differentiated Services Field"])):
    text += bytes.fromhex(df["Differentiated Services Field"][i][2:]).decode("utf-8")

print(text)
```

Using `strings` over the capture reveals this:

In cryptography, a cipher (or cypher) is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption
a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure. An alternative, less common term is encipherment. To encipher or encode is to convert information into cipher or code. In common parlance, cipher is synonymous with code, as they are both a set of steps that encrypt a message; however, the concepts are distinct in cryptography, especially classical cryptography.

In the text there is a conversation between Democleitus and Cleoxenus where they talk about some key `LOCK`.

After trying to XOR a few hex values using the key, we find that the first hex value might the the last character from the flag.

```python
>>> chr(0x31 ^ ord('L'))
'}'
>>> chr(0x31 ^ ord('O'))
'~'
>>> chr(0x31 ^ ord('C'))
'r'
>>> chr(0x31 ^ ord('K'))
'z'
```

Trying to go backwards, we expect to find "E" and "C" since the flag has this format: "ECSC{...}".

```python
>>> chr(0x0a ^ ord('L'))
'F'
>>> chr(0x0a ^ ord('O'))
'E'
>>> chr(0x0a ^ ord('C'))
'I'
>>> chr(0x0a ^ ord('K'))
'A'
>>> chr(0x0f ^ ord('L'))
'C'
>>> chr(0x0f ^ ord('O'))
'@'
>>> chr(0x0f ^ ord('C'))
'L'
>>> chr(0x0f ^ ord('K'))
'D'
```

We see that "E" is found using "O" and then "C" is found by using "L". We keep going to find the first few characters that we am sure they are in the flag (`ECSC{`).

```python
>>> chr(0x0a ^ ord('O'))
'E'
>>> chr(0x0f ^ ord('L'))
'C'
>>> chr(0x18 ^ ord('K'))
'S'
>>> chr(0x00 ^ ord('C'))
'C'
>>> chr(0x34 ^ ord('O'))
'{'
```

The pattern `OLKC` keeps repeating, so we write a python script (`main.py`) to XOR every hex value in reverse order using this cylclic sequence.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("packetz.csv")

flag = ""
key = "OLKC" * 17 + "OL"
for i in range(len(df["Differentiated Services Field"])):
    flag += chr(
        int(
            df["Differentiated Services Field"][
                len(df["Differentiated Services Field"]) - i - 1
            ],
            0,
        )
        ^ ord(key[i])
    )

print(flag)
```

The flag is indeed written in the SHA-256 format.
`ECSC{41d57a183ca0b02f471e367a190fdfd903d307fcd43accb20930f35e48074107`

## 1.

c) Identify a client and an Access Point (AP). Find the corresponding MAC addresses.
Client: Apple_82:36:3a (00:0d:93:82:36:3a)
AP: CiscoLinksys_82:b2:55 (00:0c:41:82:b2:55)

d) Identify the broadcast messages sent by the AP. Which is the SSID? Which is the beacon interval?
SSID: Coherer
BI: 100

e) Search for HTTP traffic. Find and follow a TCP or HTTP stream. Name a website the client
visits.

b) Find the values of the two nonces further used in the key agreement.
WPA Key Nonce: 3e8e967dacd960324cac5b6aa721235bf57b949771c867989f49d04ed47c6933
WPA Key Nonce: cdf405ceb9d889ef3dec42609828fae546b7add7baecbb1a394eac5214b1d386

c) Find the value of the GTK.
GTK: ee22041a83853263474c38811352282071c122359b7c35a7e7d034f3cd6ac565

d) Which of the four frames is integrity protected?
2nd, 3rd and 4th.

e) Which of the four frames contains encrypted data? Why?
The 3rd frame contains encrypted data because the AP sends the GTK encrypted.

f) Find the values of the two EAPOL keys Key Confirmation Key (KCK) and Key Encryption Key (KEK). What are these used for?
[KCK: b1cd792716762903f723424cd7d16511]
[KEK: 82a644133bfa4e0b75d96d2308358433]

KCK - used for integrity check
KEK - used to encrypt the GTK in the 3rd frame
